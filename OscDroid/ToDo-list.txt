TODO OscDroid APP:

HIGH PRIORITY FIRST:
*update class diagram for overview of the project

*Implement Connection:
	*Let user pick wifi network and connect
	*OPTIONAL: WiFi, hard coded access point
	*Set up and open socket for sending and receiving data
	*Send settings on connect/init
	*Check for errors on sending/receiving
	*Send commands/messages
	*Implement handler for receiving data
	*USB host

*Change onTouchEvent in SurfaceView
	*Remove stepless zooming; Change to volt/div and time/div changing
	*Use threshold for volt/div changing
	
*Main activity
	*Add setVoltDiv function for calling through handler from SurfaceView	

*Implement AnalogChannel class:
	*Add handler: sending of measurement values
	*Implement measurements; Use NDK / JNI / Native code
	*Find out performance benefits of Native code
	*Add switching of dataset size: 2048 if 1 channel, 1024 if 2 channels, 512 if continuous
	*Implement fixed zoomfactor for 5mv/div and 2mv/div

*Implement running modes
	*Continuous and single shot mode
	*Triggering when continuous: how?? find trigger and set fixed position?
	

*Implement HandleMessage()

*Change measurements: select type and source, max 4-6 measurements (depends on room on screen)
	*Maybe make measurements scrollable?

*Fix saving of app state on configuration changes
